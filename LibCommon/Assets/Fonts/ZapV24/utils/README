Linux Console Font Utilities
============================

The Linux Console Font Utilities package contains various applications to
manipulate Linux console fonts.  In particular, programs are included to
convert standard PSF font files to a text representation and vice versa,
allowing easy font editing using any text editor.

The following programs are included:

* ``psf2psftx``         — Convert binary PSF font to text representation
* ``psftx2psf``         — Convert PSFTX text representation to binary format
* ``freebsdvfnt2psftx`` — Convert FreeBSD VFNT font to text representation
* ``psftx2freebsdvfnt`` — Convert PSFTX representation to FreeBSD VFNT font
* ``rawfnt2psftx``      — Convert raw font file to text representation

* ``psftx-codechart``   — Generate a PDF font coverage codechart
* ``psftx-encodings``   — Check PSFTX for charmap encodings coverage
* ``psftx-sampler``     — Generate a text output font coverage sampler
* ``psftx-screenshot``  — Generate a simulated screenshot image
* ``psftx-template``    — Create a blank template PSFTX file

The following Python modules are included:

* `psffont.py`          — Object-oriented interface to in-memory PSF font
* `psfio.py`            — Input/output functions for binary PSF files
* `psftxio.py`          — Input/output functions for PSFTX text files
* `freebsdvfntio.py`    — Input/output functions for FreeBSD VFNT files
* `rawfntio.py`         — Input/output functions for raw font files
* `unicustom.py`        — Custom Unicode mapping functions

The following additional libraries are required for correct operation:

* reportlab     — Create PDF documents (required for ``psftx-codechart``)
* Pillow PIL    — Python imaging library (required for ``psftx-screenshot``)
